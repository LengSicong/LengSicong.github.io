## Introduction
Hello! I'm Sicong Leng, a 2nd-year P.h.D. at Nanyang Technological University. I am currently under Alibaba-NTU talent programme and jointly supervised by [Prof.Lu Shijian](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/shijian.lu/) ([Visual-Intelligence Lab](https://sg-vilab.github.io/)/[S-lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab)) and [Dr.Bing Lidong](https://lidongbing.github.io/) ([Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG)).

I specialize in Deep Learning with a focus on Multi-modality research, especially for Vision+Language.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, questions, or just to chat!
